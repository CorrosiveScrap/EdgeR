    <h1>Updates</h1>

        -June 8 2024
        So here we are, over a year after I pushed the first version of EdgeR and
        around 6 months since I've worked on this thing. Having a life and 
        responsabilities sucks sometimes. I dont even remember making this update
        tab honestly, in fact I dont remember making a lot of the features in EdgeR.
        Probably because I don't use them. In any case before I start typing out my 
        life story I'm going to at least try to put an update here. I'm plaing on 
        hopefully getting EdgeR to a 1.0 state but I'm not sure how much I'll support
        it after that. At the end of the day adding new stuff is hard because my code
        is awful, unreadable, and poorly optimized. I made EdgeR as a quick one or two
        week project and kept that mentality, even though it turned into something I spent
        a fair amount of time building. So I think rewriting a large amount of the program 
        will have to happen at some point. A lot of ideas I have for EdgeR also just arnt
        very doable in electron. As much as electron is nice and really easy to learn its
        not c++, rust, or some other language that can mess around much deeping in a 
        computer. That being said I think building an optional c++ companion app 
        could be cool. I have a lot of ideas for soemthing like that based on 
        what I see many people on twitter using. Thats a long way off though 
        more than likely.

        -something something 2023 I think 

        Working on Edger has been hard due to the size of the project. 
        I constantly have to go back and try to relearn parts of 
        code I forgot existed and usually have to rewrite all of it to 
        make it work properly. I never intended to keep making updates
        to the app it was only ever ment to be a silly 1 - 2 week
        project that helped me learn some new stuff but people semed
        to like the first version so I never moved on and kept 
        improving the app.
