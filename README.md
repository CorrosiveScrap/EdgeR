**Disclaimer:**  This is not actually malicious software, It's been created for entertainment purposes and is not in any way intended to cause any real damage. You will also be given a super handy uninstall.exe once EdgeR is installed if you ever need to get rid of it fast and easy.

# About
EdgeR is fetishware that continuously spammes the user with image, video, and audio pop ups of their choice at a customisable rate. EdgeR is more or less just a clone of Edgeware with much better UI, more frequent updates (probably), and a few extra quality of life changes such as being able to pause and resume popups from the system tray.


**This project is inspired by PetitTournesol's [Edgeware](https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware) I suggest checking it out if you enjoy EdgeR.**

# How to use
1) Download the zip file
2) Unzip and open the unzipped folder
3) Run EdgeR.exe (this should create a desktop icon)


- Most settings and buttons have tool tips explaining how they work if you hover over them.

# FAQ
`Q:How do I get passed the windows defender warning` <br> A: Click on more info and it will give you a button to run EdgeR anyway. <br><br>
`Q:Is there anything that makes EdgeR better than Edgeware` <br> A: It depends what your looking for, EdgeR has much better UI and customizability with the trade off of having a few less features however i'm working on updates to bring more functionality to the app. <br><br>
`Q:Does this app work on mac/linux` <br> A: EdgeR is built using electron so it should be at least partially useable but I have not tested it on anything other than windows <br><br>
`Q:When will the full version of EdgeR be released` <br> A: The current plan is to have the full version (1.0.0) done and available by June 2024. However there will be more updates before then to add content and fix bugs.<br><br>
