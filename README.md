# About
EdgR is fetishware that continuously spammes the user with image, video, and audio pop ups of their choice at a customisable rate. EdgR is more or less just a clone of Edgeware with much better UI, more frequent updates (probably), and a few extra quality of life changes such as being able to pause and resume popups from the system tray.


**This project is inspired by PetitTournesol's [Edgeware](https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware) I suggest checking it out if you enjoy EdgR.**

# FAQ
`Q:How do I get passed the windows defender warning` <br> A: Click on more info and it will give you a button to run EdgR anyway. <br><br>
`Q:What makes EdgR a better choice than Edgeware?` <br> A: EdgR has a much more user friendly front end and works right out of the box without you having to install other things like python. While not having quite the feature set of some other programs out there EdgR still has quite a few settings that will keep it feeling fresh for a long time. <br><br>
`Q:Does this app work on mac/linux` <br> A: EdgR is built using electron so it should be useable but I have not tested it on anything other than windows <br><br>
