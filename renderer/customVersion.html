    <h1>Custom EdgR version info</h1>
    <p>
        This page is here for people who may be looking to use EdgR in a more commercial way. With the introduction of a paid tier I realize the app has become a bit less friendly to customize repackage and send out. That's why I have created a commercial build that lets you send a copy to anyone that grants them the full version no strings attached. I have included a few different options for getting this build bellow with some including a few extra perks that might help strengthen your brand. Choose the package that works best for you and follow purchase instructions inside to get your copy
